# CORD-19-Question-Answering-Model
The project aims to build a Question Answering system using the roBERTa and spaCy to retrieve relevant information from the vast CORD-19 dataset of over 200,000 scientific articles related to COVID-19. RoBERTa is a powerful pre-trained transformer-based model that can be fine-tuned for various NLP tasks such as Question Answering. SpaCy is a natural language processing library that provides advanced entity recognition and parallel processing capabilities, which can significantly improve the speed and efficiency of information retrieval and Question Answering systems. Here, we are using parallel processing to speed up the inference time, allowing the model to retrieve entities more quickly and efficiently. It works by dividing a large task into smaller sub-tasks that can be processed simultaneously by multiple processors or threads. The project demonstrates the potential of natural language processing and machine learning in addressing the challenges of information retrieval from scientific literature.
